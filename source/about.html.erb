<div class="about">
  <p>Hi and welcome! I'm Chase Stephens! I was born and raised in the Madison, Wisconsin area and have now lived in the Chicagoland area for 7 years. I'm a classic Sconnie who enjoys long walks on Lake Michigan, loves <a href="http://www.carrvalleycheese.com/">cheese</a> and <a href="https://www.kringle.com/">kringle</a>, and will gladly consume multiple brats and beers while watching the good old Packers. Interests include swimming of any kind, great family and friends, an intriguing story, and most recently web development.</p>
  <p>I attended Northwestern University in Evanston, IL and received a B.A. in Economics with a minor in Business Institutions in 2014. After working in banking for 2 years after college, I found a lack of passion in my life. I decided to take matters into my own hands and find professional happiness in the form of continual learning, aka Software Development! I quit my position and joined a coding bootcamp in the winter of 2016 to challenge myself, take on professional risk, and dive headfirst into something extremely rewarding and personally exciting. I completed <a href="https://devbootcamp.com/">DevBootcamp</a> in 2017 and see it as a vital stepping stone to a creative line of work that challenges me to build something everyday.</p>
  <p>As a current Full-Stack Developer, I work in front-end user experience optimization, database management/standardization, customer/client support, and new functionality development/testing. I thrive in a team environment and think that the motto "with their powers combined" should be used more often. Trying to fix challenging problems can keep me occupied for hours. Striving to never have a 'zero-day' helps me pursue the unknown, ask for help when I get stuck, and find joy in the small things.</p>
  <p>This blog is a hodge-podge of personal reflections, insightful discoveries, and frustrating explorations into aspects of Software Development. We can lump them all into learning experiences I suppose, but at the end of the day they are all useful in their own ways.</p>
  <p>Thanks for reading and enjoy!</p>
